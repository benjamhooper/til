    Simple script to auto-generate the README.md file for a til project.
    NOTE: Someone who wanted to be fancy would actually use a template engine
    for this, but this seemed like a task for which it is best to only require
    python.  This is not a general purpose script, but tailored for the format
    being used for "Today I Learned" repos.
    Apply as a git hook by running the following command in linux:
        cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../createReadme.py pre-commit && cd -

HEADER = '''# TIL

> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post.

'''

FOOTER = '''## Usage

After creating a new entry, run `./createReadme.py > README.md` to regenerate
the readme with the new data.

If you are using git, you can install this script as a pre-commit git hook so
that it is autogenerated on each commit.  Use the following command:
    `cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../createReadme.py pre-commit && cd -`

If you are on windows use genpushTIL.ps1. I created this for me because pre-commit git hook was running into issues.


## About

I shamelessly stole this idea from
[jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) who claims to have stolen
it from others.
