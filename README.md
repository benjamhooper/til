> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post.

## Usage

After creating a new entry, run `./createReadme.py > README.md` to regenerate
the readme with the new data.

If you are using git, you can install this script as a pre-commit git hook so
that it is autogenerated on each commit.  Use the following command:
    `cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../createReadme.py pre-commit && cd -`

If you are on windows use genpushTIL.ps1. I created this for me because pre-commit git hook was running into issues.


## About

I shamelessly stole this idea from
[jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) who claims to have stolen
it from others.

I shamelessly stole the autogenerate readme script from [Jim Anderson](https://github.com/jima80525/til) - [createReadme.py](createReadme.py)
